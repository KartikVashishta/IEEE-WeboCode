## Tech Stack used:- 

- HTML5 - for barebones of the website.
- CSS (Bootstrap) - to write quicker, cleaner and responsive code.
- Javascript (jQuery) - to implement functionality (search bar) and allow smooth animation.
- GSAP - implemented with jQuery libraries to enable scroll trigger in a more responsive and faster format than the standard way.

## Competitive Edge:-
